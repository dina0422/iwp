(4, 'Painful mouth / throat post covid', 'Hi i am currently 4 weeks post covid and feel worse now than when i had covid. I have a terribly dry throat and occasional cough. My mouth and tongue sting and it might sound weird but my tongue feels heavy in my mouth. When i swallow i sometimes feel like theres something stuck in my throat. I also have tinnitus and occasional earache so i am generally feeling bleurgh. Is there anyone else who is having / has had these symptoms as the longer they go on the more i start thinking theres something more sinister going on ? Thanks'),
(7, 'Possible symptoms of DVT or just a bad coincidence', 'After testing positive on Feb 9, I finally tested negative and showed antibodies on Feb 22, 4 days ago.\r\n\r\nI have gone back to my activities which mean staying at my desk for several hours.\r\n\r\nEarlier today I had just gone down and up the stairs at work, and within minutes of sitting down again I felt a sudden sharp pain in my right calf. It had never happened before and I didn\'t hurt myself or anything like that. Then I also started experiencing a slight feeling of warmth, not really on the whole leg but my foot feels warm.\r\n\r\nMinutes later I also felt another jolt of pain close to the arch my foot.\r\n\r\nA week ago I had a couple of blood tests to check for anything odd, my D Dimer levels were both times within range, and it actually went down by a single digit the second time. My doctor checked it all and said they were fine and since they weren\'t increasing it wasn\'t a problem.\r\n\r\nI don\'t notice any swelling so far and the leg isn\'t painful to the touch, I actually haven\'t felt the pain since that one time. Although it does feel slightly weird, like loose but not really, and like I said the calf isn\'t painful any more.\r\n\r\nCould these be DVT symptoms almost a week after getting better of Covid, and with 2 previous blood tests showing no sign of coagulation problems?\r\n\r\nOr is this just a bad coincidence?'),
(8, 'Tested positive on 28th Dec 20 - my symptoms etc', 'Hi all,\r\n\r\nThought I would pop on here to share my experience of Covid. I\'ll bulletpoint to keep it simple.\r\n\r\n*14th&15th Dec, I was in contact with someone who tested positive for covid (they tested positive on the 16th)\r\n\r\n*21st Dec - experienced sharp shooting pains all over my body - not constant and did not interfere with daily activities.\r\n\r\n23rd Dec - feeling extremely tired but didn\'t interfere with daily activities, minor loss of taste.\r\n24th Dec - still tired, sharp pains gone. Felt like I had small blobs of phlegm stuck in my throat - not low enough to cough up and not high enough to blow out nose. Not very hungry.\r\n25th Dec - the person I was in contact with passed away. (he DID have numerous underlying health conditions and sepsis from a UTI). Ability to smell and taste things 90% gone.\r\n28th Dec - go for a test. Feeling tired and breathless - this was thankfully minor and manageable. OK when I sit in the warm.\r\n29th Dec - Positive result. I felt so so scared. I live in a with my Fiance and his mum. We are all in separate rooms - isolating. Never felt so alone and scared.\r\n30th Dec to 2nd Jan - every night, going to bed anxious. Scared of getting worse, scared incase I have the same fate as the friend we lost. Weird dreams about food and craving food! Taste and smell came back over these days to about 80%. Breathlessness getting better but still taking it easy and listening to my body.\r\n3rd Jan - developed 1 patch of rash. The \'Herald spot\' for pityriasis rosea (confirmed by a DR)\r\nRecovering day by day.\r\n21/01/21 - I am back at work as of a couple weeks ago. Still feel like I have hayfever every now and then. Managed to go for a small run last weekend (Usually run 5k at least twice a week) - went better than I thought. I still have the rash and the sharp shooting pains have come back and bite every now and then.\r\n\r\nI must admit the worst experience of it all for me was the anxiety that came with it. You only hear and see negatives on the news and after my friend passing, it was really hard to think I would get off lightly.\r\n\r\nI\'m still not 100% but I am hoping that as time goes by, I will gradually get back to my normal self. Time will tell I guess.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to ask me anything etc, please let me know. Happy to help anyone if I can from my experience.\r\n\r\nHannah xx');
